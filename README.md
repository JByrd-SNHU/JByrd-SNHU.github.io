## Initial Artifact <a name="initial-artifact"></a>

### Description <a name="initial-artifact-description"></a>

The artifact central to my enhancements is the "RGB LED Cube Control Software", a project initiated during my Electrical Engineering Technology Associate 
degree program's capstone in 2015. Initially, I constructed a 4x4x4 LED Cube with RGB LEDs, shown below, integrating it with an FPGA development board and 
crafting custom firmware to manipulate the 52 control lines governing the 64 LEDs.

In a recent pursuit of rekindling my enthusiasm for the project, I designed additional circuitry to interface my RGB LED Cube Control Software with an 
Arduino Uno, facilitating control over the RGB LEDs. Prior to the start of this course, I had developed a simple functional user interface (UI), shown 
below, establishing communication with the Arduino Uno through a COM Port. This initial UI empowered me to illuminate one color of one LED based on 
user-defined color, X, Y, and Z values.

Having accomplished the hardware integration and circuitry enhancements, the focus of my Computer Science Capstone project pivots decisively to the 
evolution of the RGB LED Cube Control Software. With the foundational hardware components in place and the initial user interface demonstrating functional 
control over individual LEDs, my aim is to delve into advanced features and optimizations within the software realm. This shift marks the latest chapter 
in the ongoing development of a project that seamlessly marries my technical skills in both hardware and software domains.

### Enhancement One Narrative

#### Artifact Choice <a name="enhancement-one-artifact-choice"></a>

For Enhancement One, which concentrated on **Software Design/Engineering**, I selected the RGB LED Cube Control Software as the focal artifact. A 
comprehensive description of this particular artifact has been provided in detail in the preceding section 
titled "Initial Artifact - Description".  
Link to [Initial Artifact - Description](#initial-artifact-description)

#### Why I Chose This Artifact to Display My Skills in Software Design/Engineering

For this phase of development, I selected the "RGB LED Cube Control Software" due to its unique amalgamation of hardware and software components. 
The project's standout features in Enhancement One include a thorough UI overhaul, seamless integration of security-centric features, and its 
pivotal role as the starting point for full-stack application development. Collectively, these aspects emphasize my proficiency and adaptability 
in software design and engineering.

#### The Modifications I Made to the RGB LED Cube Control Software in this Phase of Development

##### UI Overhaul

The decision to overhaul the user interface (UI) exemplifies my proficiency in graphical user interface design. In creating a new project within 
QT Creator, I demonstrated the ability to construct an intuitive and visually appealing UI. The transition from a singular view to a multi-tab 
interface comprised of Login, Hardware Init, Cube Control, and Database tabs, reflects my capacity to architect complex UI structures.

##### Login Tab Functionality

![Login Tab](/Images/Login_Tab.png)  
The implementation of the Login tab introduces elements of software security and user authentication to the project. The creation of a 
userCredentials class, complete with functions to check and verify user credentials, showcases my expertise in implementing secure software 
practices. The seamless integration of login functionality, including feedback mechanisms for successful and failed attempts, underscores my 
attention to both usability and security aspects.

##### Dynamic Hardware Initialization Tab Functionality

![Hardware Init Tab](/Images/Hardware_Init_Tab.png)  
The Dynamic Hardware Initialization functionality further highlights my skills in software development. The addition of a QSerialPort object 
demonstrates my ability to integrate external communication protocols into the software architecture. The implementation of error handling 
mechanisms, such as checking for valid COM port entries and securing against repeated initialization attempts, showcases my commitment to robust 
and reliable software design.  
  
In summary, the RGB LED Cube Control Software is a compelling addition to my ePortfolio as it not only represents the evolution of a hardware 
project but also serves as a testament to my growth in software development. The enhancements made in the UI, security features, and dynamic 
hardware initialization underscore my ability to conceive and implement sophisticated software solutions. The ongoing refinement of this artifact 
aligns with my commitment to advancing and showcasing my software development skills throughout my academic and professional journey.
