### Description <a name="initial-artifact-description"></a>

The artifact central to my enhancements is the "RGB LED Cube Control Software", a project initiated during my Electrical Engineering Technology Associate 
degree program's capstone in 2015. Initially, I constructed a 4x4x4 LED Cube with RGB LEDs, shown below, integrating it with an FPGA development board and 
crafting custom firmware to manipulate the 52 control lines governing the 64 LEDs.

In a recent pursuit of rekindling my enthusiasm for the project, I designed additional circuitry to interface my RGB LED Cube Control Software with an 
Arduino Uno, facilitating control over the RGB LEDs. Prior to the start of this course, I had developed a simple functional user interface (UI), shown 
below, establishing communication with the Arduino Uno through a COM Port. This initial UI empowered me to illuminate one color of one LED based on 
user-defined color, X, Y, and Z values.

Having accomplished the hardware integration and circuitry enhancements, the focus of my Computer Science Capstone project pivots decisively to the 
evolution of the RGB LED Cube Control Software. With the foundational hardware components in place and the initial user interface demonstrating functional 
control over individual LEDs, my aim is to delve into advanced features and optimizations within the software realm. This shift marks the latest chapter 
in the ongoing development of a project that seamlessly marries my technical skills in both hardware and software domains.
